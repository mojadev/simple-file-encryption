The keys in this folder can be generated using `npm run genkeys`.
They are intentionally left here in the repository and are not used in any production environment.

Consider them as a reference in case you aren't sure how your keys should look.

The file [test is the private key](./test) while [test.pub is the public key](./test.pub).
